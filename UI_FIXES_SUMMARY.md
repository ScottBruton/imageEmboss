# UI Fixes Applied - Summary

## âœ… **All Issues Fixed Successfully!**

### **1. Drag and Drop Functionality** âœ…
- **Problem**: Drag and drop wasn't working for image files
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `image_dropped` signal to `ImageGraphicsView`
  - Connected signal to `load_image_from_path` method in both views
  - Now properly handles dropping image files onto either view

### **2. Tooltips on Labels** âœ…
- **Problem**: Tooltips only showed on sliders, not on labels
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `setToolTip()` to all parameter labels
  - Both labels and sliders now show helpful tooltips

### **3. Better Tooltip Descriptions** âœ…
- **Problem**: Tooltips were too technical
- **Solution**: 
  - Rewrote all tooltips in layman's terms
  - Added explanations of what each parameter does and why you'd use it
  - Examples:
    - "Controls how much the image is smoothed while preserving edges"
    - "Controls how thick the lines will be in your final DXF file"
    - "Controls how many of the largest shapes to keep"

### **4. Edit Tool Selection** âœ…
- **Problem**: Multiple edit tools could be selected at once
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `QButtonGroup` for mutually exclusive selection
  - Only one edit tool can be selected at a time
  - Includes: View, Paint, Eraser, Line, and Shape tools

### **5. Cursor for Tools** âœ…
- **Problem**: Cursors didn't match the previous application
- **Solution**: 
  - Added cursor setting based on edit mode
  - View mode: Arrow cursor
  - Paint/Eraser/Line/Shape modes: Cross cursor
  - Applied to both original and DXF views

## ðŸŽ¯ **Technical Implementation Details:**

### **Drag and Drop:**
```python
# Added signal
image_dropped = Signal(str)

# Connected in both views
self.original_view.image_dropped.connect(self.load_image_from_path)
self.dxf_view.image_dropped.connect(self.load_image_from_path)
```

### **Button Group:**
```python
# Created mutually exclusive button group
self.edit_button_group = QButtonGroup()
self.edit_button_group.addButton(self.view_btn, 0)
self.edit_button_group.addButton(self.paint_btn, 1)
# ... etc
```

### **Cursors:**
```python
# Set cursor based on mode
if mode == "view":
    cursor = QCursor(Qt.ArrowCursor)
elif mode == "paint":
    cursor = QCursor(Qt.CrossCursor)
# ... etc
```

## ðŸš€ **Result:**
The application now has:
- âœ… Working drag and drop for images
- âœ… Helpful tooltips on all controls
- âœ… Mutually exclusive edit tool selection
- âœ… Proper cursors for different tools
- âœ… User-friendly descriptions in layman's terms
