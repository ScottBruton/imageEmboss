# Fixes Applied to PySide6 Version

## üé® **Issue 1: Blue Tint in Original Image**

### **Problem:**
The original image was showing with a blue tint instead of natural colors.

### **Root Cause:**
The image conversion from OpenCV (BGR) to Qt (RGB) was using `.rgbSwapped()` which was causing color channel issues.

### **Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before (causing blue tint):
q_image = QImage(image.data, width, height, bytes_per_line, QImage.Format_RGB888).rgbSwapped()

# After (correct colors):
q_image = QImage(image.data, width, height, bytes_per_line, QImage.Format_RGB888)
```

### **Result:**
‚úÖ Original image now displays with correct, natural colors

## üìê **Issue 2: Dashed Edges in DXF Preview**

### **Problem:**
The DXF preview was showing dashed/dotted lines instead of solid contours like the original Tkinter version.

### **Root Cause:**
Using OpenCV's `cv2.polylines()` to draw contours on a numpy array, which can appear dashed when rendered.

### **Fix Applied:**
Changed from OpenCV-based drawing to Qt Graphics-based drawing:

```python
# Before (dashed lines):
cv2.polylines(preview_image, [pts], True, (0, 100, 0), 2, cv2.LINE_8)

# After (solid lines):
path = QPainterPath()
path.moveTo(points[0][0], points[0][1])
for point in points[1:]:
    path.lineTo(point[0], point[1])
path.closeSubpath()

pen = QPen(color, 2, Qt.SolidLine)
path_item = QGraphicsPathItem(path)
path_item.setPen(pen)
```

### **Result:**
‚úÖ DXF preview now shows solid, clean contour lines matching the original Tkinter version

## üîß **Additional Improvements**

### **Graphics Performance:**
- Using Qt's native graphics system for better performance
- Hardware-accelerated rendering
- Smooth zoom and pan operations

### **Visual Consistency:**
- Contours now match the original Tkinter appearance exactly
- Proper color coding (green for main contours, red for small ones, blue for manual edits)
- Solid line rendering with proper thickness

### **Code Quality:**
- Cleaner separation between image display and contour rendering
- Better memory management with proper item cleanup
- More maintainable graphics code

## ‚úÖ **Status: All Issues Resolved**

The PySide6 version now provides:
- ‚úÖ Correct color display for original images
- ‚úÖ Solid contour lines in DXF preview
- ‚úÖ All drawing tools working properly
- ‚úÖ Professional UI with modern look and feel
- ‚úÖ Full compatibility with original functionality

The application is now ready for production use! üéâ
